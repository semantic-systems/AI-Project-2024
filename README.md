To provide guidance to students who may be new to development, I provide below a  sequence of topics the students should learn to be able to develop a working project.

 1. Learn git
		 You will use git to maintain your code, so the first step is to learn this tool.
		https://github.com/git-guides
		https://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/ (more advanced)
 2. Learn Python
		https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html
		Also make sure you do all Python development in a virtual environment https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
 3. Understand the concept of full-stack development
		https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/full-stack-development
 4. Learn about REST APIs
		 https://blog.postman.com/rest-api-examples/
 5. Learn the Flask framework (or nodejs) (OPTIONAL, see 8)
		 Flask is a Python based framework that handles the backend API. It is easier if you already know Python. Some people are more comfortable with javascript and for them nodejs is better.
			https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html
			https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/
 6. Learn a web frontend framework (OPTIONAL, see 8)
			 HTML https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp
			 CSS https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp
			 Javascript https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp
			 React https://www.w3schools.com/react/default.asp
			 Bootstrap https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_ver.asp
 7. Learn a database
			 What kind of database should I use for my application? https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-choose-the-right-database-for-your-application/ 
			 Decide between SQL vs NO-SQL. You may also need a Graph database.
		 
 8. As an alternative to 5 and 6, you could learn Streamlit which combines frontend and backend into a single Python framework, but this offers lower flexibility. **I recommend this framework for this course to save your time.**

 9. Learn deployment and packaging with docker and docker-compose.
			 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
 10. Learn SCRUM for project management
